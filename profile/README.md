# Laboratorio de dEtecci√ìn de Part√≠culas Astropart√≠culas y RaDiaci√≥n  

This is the Github repo for the LEOPARD Lab at Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) supports advanced research 
in physics and engineering by providing infrastructure and fostering collaborations, both locally and internationally. 
It is involved with significant scientific collaborations such as the CMS at 
[CERN's LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) and [The Latin American Giant 
Observatory (LAGO)](http://lagoproject.net/index.html). The lab's research focuses on particle physics, astroparticle 
physics, and the development of detection systems. Its main activities include analyzing particle collider data, 
studying cosmic rays for high-energy phenomena, monitoring space weather, and innovating in detection technologies.
